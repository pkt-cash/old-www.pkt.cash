PKT is a fork of bitcoin with it's own genesis block. It uses [PacketCrypt](https://github.com/cjdelisle/PacketCrypt) proof of work which requires internet bandwidth in order to mine and it has a *network steward* address which receives 20% of every coinbase.

## What is a network steward?
The network steward is an address which gets 20% of every new block-mine so that the developers can <s>have lamborghinis</s> finance the building of mesh network technology. Unlike a premine or founder's fee, the recipient of the network steward payout can be changed by a PoS vote.

## What can you do with it?
Not a whole lot at the moment, there's a text based wallet but in order to use it, you need to run a [full node](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd).

If you're ready to try out the text-based wallet, check out [wallet setup](https://pkt.cash/wallet_setup).

## So you wanna mine
The PKT chain uses the [PacketCrypt](https://github.com/cjdelisle/PacketCrypt) work algorithm.
PacketCrypt has 2 distinct stages, first an *announcement* stage wherein a miner creates a small
(1KB) message which proves that they did some work, the second stage is the ordinary block mining
stage where a block miner gets a discount on the work they need to do if they can prove that they
have lots of announcements in memory at the time of mining. Importantly, announcements can contain
*content* which, due to it's value to block miners, will be spread far and wide creating a
decentralized broadcast medium for small messages.
